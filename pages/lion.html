      <h1 class="text-tmain">Physical characteristics of Lions</h1>
      <p class="fs-4">Reaching up to 250 kg (550 lb), lions are the second-largest in the cat family (the tiger is the largest).</p>
      <p class="fs-4">During confrontations with others, the mane makes the lion look bigger than he really is. With powerful legs, a strong jaw, and long canine teeth, the lion can bring down and kill large prey. Lion coloration varies from light
        buff to
        yellowish, reddish or dark ochraceous brown. The underparts are generally lighter and the tail tuft is black. The color of the mane varies from blond to black. The lion is a carnivore and a hunter. Its legs are short with very powerful
        muscles. Male lions are 20 to 35% larger than the females and 50% heavier. Each lion has, what are called, "whisker spots". The pattern formed by this top row of whiskers differs in every lion and remains the same throughout its lifetime.</p>
      <h1 class="text-tmain">Diet</h1>
      <p class="fs-4">Adult females require an average of 11 pounds of meat per day and adult males, 15.4 lbs. The pride provides food to its sick and wounded members but not to the male. The male uses his size to take what he wants of the lioness'
        kill. A typical diet will include zebra, giraffe, buffalo, wildebeest, gazelles and impala. Lions are opportunistic and will readily scavenge the kills of cheetahs, leopards, wild dogs and hyenas.</p>
      <h1 class="text-tmain">Habitat and Geographical Distribution</h1>
      <p class="fs-4">Rich grasslands of East Africa to sands of Kalahari Desert, South Sahara to South Africa, excluding the Congo rain forest. They avoid dense forests because prey is scarce. Competition for Africa's grasslands by humans has
        drastically reduced the lions' range. Although lions were once widespread throughout much of Africa, Asia, Europe, and even prehistoric North and South America, they currently exist in the wild only in sub-Saharan Africa and in Asia with a
        critically endangered remnant population in northwest India. The lion is a vulnerable species, having seen a possibly irreversible population decline of 30 to 50% over the past two decades in its African range. Although the cause of the
        decline is not well-understood, habitat loss and conflicts with humans are currently the greatest causes of concern.</p>
      <h1 class="text-tmain">Life span</h1>
      <p class="fs-4">In the wild, lions live for approximately 12â€“18 years, while in captivity they can live over 24 years.</p>
      <h1 class="text-tmain">Reproduction in lions</h1>
      <p class="fs-4">After a gestation period of 100-110 days, the pregnant female leaves the pride and finds a place to deliver. Depending on the physical characteristics of their habitat, lions will hide their newborn cubs in marshes or kopjes.
        The number of cubs born depends on the age and dietary condition of the mother. The litter size is 1 to 6 offspring. Cubs are nursed 6-7 months. Cubs reach sexual maturity at 24 to 28 months in captivity and at 36 to 46 months in the wild. If
        a pride is taken over by a new male who has defeated the top resident male, he will most likely kill any existing cubs that are under 2 years old.</p>
